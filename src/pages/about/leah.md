<span class="leah">Leah</span>, on the other hand, is the artist of our system.
She is a trans woman who uses
<span class="pronoun she">she</span>/<span class="pronoun fae">fae</span> 
pronouns.
She comes up whenever we need to create some art, or if she decides to dedicate 5+
hours of our life drawing in the night. She primarily creates oil paintings, though she
also uses digital tools like [GIMP].
[You can find some of her works here.][works]
