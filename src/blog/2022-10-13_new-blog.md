title: New Blog!
description: >
  It's here! I've finally found time to work on the site again,
  and with much encouragement from my English teacher, I've started this blog to well,
  blog about bloggy stuff.

section: Misc
tags:
  - post
  - introduction

I still don't know what to put here -- definitely open to suggestions about that
-- but I intend to talk about some interesting things I discover and some
interesting activities I do. Technical deep dives, tutorials, opinions, how-tos,
all that jazz. Should be mostly about the Rust programming language and art,
since well, that's what I do.

I don't know how to conclude this post! Be on the look out for new posts I
guess. XD
