It's here! I've finally found time to work on the site again,
and with much encouragement from my English teacher, I've started this blog to well,
blog about bloggy stuff.

<!-- MORE -->

I still don't know what to put here -- definitely open to suggestions about that --
but I intend to talk about some interesting things I discover and some interesting
activities I do. Technical deep dives, tutorials, opinions, how-tos, all that jazz.
Should be mostly about the Rust programming language and art, since well, that's
what I do.

I don't know how to conclude this post! Be on the look out for new posts I guess. XD
